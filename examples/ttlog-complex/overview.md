## üéâ THE MOST COMPLEX TTLOG EXAMPLE OF ALL TIME! üéâ

I've created the **ultimate complex example** that pushes your ttlog library to its absolute limits. This distributed microservices simulation includes:

### üèóÔ∏è **System Architecture (12 Microservices)**
- **User Service**: Registration, authentication, profile management
- **Product Service**: Catalog management, search optimization
- **Order Service**: Order processing, workflow orchestration  
- **Payment Service**: Payment gateway integration, fraud detection
- **Inventory Service**: Stock management, low-stock alerting
- **Notification Service**: Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push)
- **Analytics Service**: Real-time analytics, anomaly detection
- **Audit Service**: Security logging, compliance tracking
- **Recommendation Service**: ML-based product recommendations
- **Search Service**: Elasticsearch-style product search
- **Pricing Service**: Dynamic pricing, discount calculations
- **Shipping Service**: Logistics, delivery tracking

### üöÄ **Advanced Features**

**Distributed Tracing & Observability:**
- Correlation IDs across all service boundaries
- Parent-child span relationships
- Request flow visualization through trace context
- Business transaction tracking

**Resilience & Fault Tolerance:**
