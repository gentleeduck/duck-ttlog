//! # Buffer Layer Module
//!
//! High-performance tracing layers that bridge the `tracing` crate with the custom
//! ring buffer logging system. This module provides multiple layer implementations
//! optimized for different throughput and latency requirements.
//!
//! ## Layer Variants
//!
//! 1. **BufferLayer** - Standard implementation with stack-based event building
//! 2. **BufferLayerWithBuilder** - Uses thread-local builders for complex event construction
//! 3. **BatchedBufferLayer** - Batches events for maximum throughput scenarios
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! All layers implement the `tracing_subscriber::Layer` trait and:
//! - Convert `tracing::Event` to custom `LogEvent` structures
//! - Use string interning to reduce memory usage
//! - Send events to a dedicated writer thread via channels
//! - Provide non-blocking operation to avoid impacting application performance
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//!
//! | Layer Type | Latency | Throughput | Memory | Use Case |
//! |------------|---------|------------|--------|----------|
//! | BufferLayer | Lowest | Medium | Lowest | General purpose |
//! | BufferLayerWithBuilder | Medium | Medium | Medium | Complex events |
//! | BatchedBufferLayer | Higher | Highest | Higher | High-volume logging |
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
//!
//! // Standard layer for most use cases
//! let layer = BufferLayer::new(sender, interner);
//! let subscriber = tracing_subscriber::Registry::default().with(layer);
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)?;
//!
//! // Now tracing macros work with custom backend
//! tracing::info!("Application started");
//! tracing::error!(error = %err, "Database connection failed");
//! ```

/// Standard buffer layer optimized for general-purpose logging.
///
/// This layer provides the best balance of performance and simplicity for most
/// applications. It uses stack-based event building to minimize allocations
/// and avoid thread-local state management.
///
/// ## Design Goals
/// - **Minimal latency**: Direct stack-based event construction
/// - **No allocations**: Uses efficient string interning and stack building
/// - **Non-blocking**: Never blocks the calling thread
/// - **Simple**: Straightforward implementation with minimal complexity
///
/// ## Performance
/// - **Hot path**: ~50-100ns per log event (depending on string cache hits)
/// - **Memory**: Zero allocations per event after interner warm-up
/// - **Concurrency**: Fully lock-free on the producer side

  /// - **Speed**: Uses stack-based building and avoids Arc clones
  /// - **Reliability**: Non-blocking sends with appropriate error handling
  /// - **Memory**: Leverages string interning to reduce duplication
  ///
  /// ## Process Flow
  /// 1. Extract metadata (timestamp, level, target) from tracing event
  /// 2. Visit event fields to extract the message
  /// 3. Build LogEvent using stack-based construction
  /// 4. Send to writer thread with non-blocking try_send
  /// 5. Handle channel errors appropriately
  ///
  /// ## Error Handling
  /// - **Disconnected channel**: Logs error and continues (writer thread died)
  /// - **Full channel**: Silently drops event (backpressure handling)
  ///
  /// ## Performance Notes
  /// - Avoids `Arc::clone` by using reference to interner
  /// - Uses `try_send` to never block application threads
  /// - Optimized message extraction with custom visitor

/// - **Pros**: Better for complex events with many fields
/// - **Cons**: Slightly higher memory usage due to thread-local builders
/// - **Cons**: Small initialization overhead for builder creation
///
/// ## When to Use
/// - Events have many structured fields
/// - Complex event transformation is needed

/// - **Pros**: Highest throughput for burst logging
/// - **Pros**: Reduced channel contention
/// - **Cons**: Higher latency (events batched before sending)

/// ## Batching Behavior
/// - Events are collected in batches of 32 per thread
/// - Batches are flushed immediately when full

/// ## When to Use
/// - Very high-volume logging (>10K events/second)
/// - Burst logging scenarios (many events in short time)
/// - When throughput is more important than latency
/// - Applications with predictable logging patterns
