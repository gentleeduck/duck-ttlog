## Core Design Philosophy

The library solves a common production problem: you need detailed logging for debugging, but traditional logging can slow down your application. TTLog's solution is elegant:

1. **Keep recent logs in memory** (ring buffer) for ultra-fast access
2. **Only write to disk when something important happens** (panics, periodic intervals, manual requests)
3. **Never block the application** - if the logging system can't keep up, it drops events rather than slowing down your app

## Why This Design Works

**For Performance**: The hot path (your application logging) only does a single allocation and a non-blocking channel send. All the expensive work (serialization, compression, disk I/O) happens on a separate thread.

**For Debugging**: When your app crashes, the panic hook automatically captures all recent events to disk. You get the "last words" of your application without any performance cost during normal operation.

**For Production**: The ring buffer prevents memory leaks, backpressure is handled gracefully, and the atomic file operations ensure you never get corrupted snapshots.

The architecture is particularly clever because it separates the concerns completely - your application thread only cares about getting events into the buffer quickly, while the writer thread handles all the complex persistence logic independently.

This would be especially valuable for high-throughput applications, real-time systems, or anywhere you need detailed logging but can't afford the performance overhead of traditional file-based logging.
